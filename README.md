Hello there! I am the developer of the BisonEngine and I am going to show you how to make a simple project in it.
The Game Engine is only available for Windows for now. BTW you need to have th JVM and JRE installed on your computer.

I assume you have lwjgl installed on your computer and you've set it up, if not you can watch this video:

Now you can go to the example package and run. if you see a screen with a squre with colors, that means you have set it up correctly.

You can now delete the examples package and go to the games package, then you will see a main file. the file has am already made window for you to start making games. good luck!
